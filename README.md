# DateAndTime Library

When working with date and time in your applications there are important things to consider, for example:

- The different timezones
- Daylight saving time
- The current system date and time
- The milliseconds it takes to startup a system
  
The DataFlex DateAndTime Library contains several functions to assist with anything date and time related in your DataFlex applications.This repository contains a library and a demo application. The library can be used when working with dates and times. The library contains three classes:

1. cDateTimeHandler
2. cMathHandler
3. cLocaleInfoHandler
   
##### Note
The [Conversions Library](https://github.com/DataFlex-dev/Conversions) is needed to be able to use this library
